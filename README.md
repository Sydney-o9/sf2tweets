Symfony2 Tweets
===============

Symfony2 Tweets is an open-source site that utilizes Symfony2, Node.js, 
Socket.IO, FOSRestBundle and a few of my bundles to deliver real time Symfony2 
tweets and plot them on a map if geographical coordinates are available.

This site was put created as a fun project to test out my Symfony2 bundle.
